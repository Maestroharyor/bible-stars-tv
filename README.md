Bible Star TV is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created by [`Virem Technologies`](https://virem.com.ng/) 

## Running on Your Device

After cloning the repo on your device, move into the project directory and run the development server via the terminal/command line:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npx next dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## Building for Deployment
After all the necessary changes are made, the app has to be  compiled before being pushed to any server:

```bash
npm run build
# or
npx next build
# or
yarn build
```

```
Any and every changes made should/must be compiled before they can reflect on the server
```
